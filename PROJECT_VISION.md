PROJECT NAME: SMART KASUA

PROJECT TYPE:
AI-assisted e-commerce marketplace with multi-merchant purchasing,
centralized order coordination, physical product verification,
and an expandable distribution and fulfillment network.

PROJECT VISION:

Build Smart Kasua into a trusted digital marketplace that connects
consumers with merchants, allows customers to purchase products from
multiple merchants in a single checkout, and coordinates the fulfillment
of those orders through an increasingly sophisticated physical distribution
network.

The long-term objective is to establish a central distribution station
that receives goods from participating merchants, verifies them, coordinates
inventory and shipments, consolidates suitable orders, and manages dispatch
to customers.

The system must be designed to scale from a relatively lean marketplace
operation into a network of warehouses, collection points, and regional
distribution facilities.

AI must support the operation by improving product discovery, merchant
insights, demand forecasting, fraud detection, customer support, inventory
planning, and logistics optimization.

The initial system must remain affordable and practical to build, test,
and operate in Nigeria.

--------------------------------------------------
1. CORE DESIGN PRINCIPLES
--------------------------------------------------

1. Build a product-first marketplace while maintaining merchant storefronts.

2. Allow customers to purchase products from multiple merchants through
   one customer-facing checkout.

3. Maintain separate merchant suborders and financial records behind
   the unified order.

4. Make product discovery competitive, transparent, and resistant to
   unnecessary concentration among a small number of merchants.

5. Support both general merchants and specialist merchants.

6. Use AI to assist customers, merchants, administrators, and logistics
   operators without allowing AI to make uncontrolled financial or
   consequential operational decisions.

7. Design the software to support a future physical central distribution
   network.

8. Build a modular architecture so different development teams can work
   on independent components.

9. Prioritize security, reliability, transaction integrity, auditability,
   and maintainability.

10. Avoid unnecessary complexity and expensive automation during the
    initial launch.

11. Design for realistic Nigerian operating conditions, including
    variable connectivity, mobile-first access, different payment methods,
    and potentially uneven delivery infrastructure.

12. Make all major operational decisions traceable and measurable.

--------------------------------------------------
2. CUSTOMER APPLICATION
--------------------------------------------------

Develop a customer-facing marketplace that supports:

- Account registration and authentication.
- Customer profiles and saved addresses.
- Product browsing and category navigation.
- Product search and filtering.

- A unified checkout experience.
- Transparent delivery fees and estimated delivery times.
- Supported online payment methods.
- Order confirmation and tracking.
- Cancellation and refund requests.
- Customer support.
- Order history and receipts.
- Notifications about order progress.

The application must clearly communicate product availability,
merchant identity, applicable fees, delivery expectations, and
relevant return conditions.

--------------------------------------------------
3. MERCHANT PORTAL
--------------------------------------------------

Develop a merchant dashboard that supports:

- Registration and onboarding.
- Required identity and business verification.
- Merchant policy acceptance.
- Product creation and editing.
- Product photographs and specifications.
- Pricing and stock management.
- Category selection.
- Order notifications.
- Order acceptance and fulfillment status.
- Collection and delivery coordination.
- Sales and payout records.
- Customer questions and support.
- Product performance analytics.
- Demand insights.
- Pricing comparisons.
- Stock recommendations.
- Merchant performance reports.

Support both general merchants selling many product categories
and specialist merchants focusing on particular categories.

Do not require merchants to specialize in order to participate.

--------------------------------------------------
4. PRODUCT CATALOG AND DISCOVERY ENGINE
--------------------------------------------------

Build a central product catalog that supports:

- Product categories and subcategories.
- Searchable product attributes.
- Product variants.
- Merchant-specific offers.
- Product price and availability.
- Comparable offers from multiple merchants.
- Product condition and relevant authenticity information.
- Delivery estimates.
- Return conditions.
- Duplicate listing detection.
- Search relevance and filtering.

Separate the underlying product record from each merchant's offer
whenever the product identity and attributes can be reliably matched.

Do not incorrectly combine products that differ materially in
model, specification, size, condition, authenticity, or other
important attributes.

Develop ranking rules that consider:

- Search relevance.
- Total customer cost.
- Product suitability.
- Stock availability.
- Seller reliability.
- Verified quality information.
- Delivery estimates.
- Return conditions.
- Customer preferences.
- Marketplace fairness requirements.

Prevent historical sales volume from becoming the only meaningful
ranking factor.

Measure how much visibility different merchants receive.

Develop controlled exposure mechanisms that give eligible newer
or smaller merchants opportunities to be discovered when their
products are relevant and competitive.

Do not promise equal sales or use random ranking as a substitute
for useful recommendations.

--------------------------------------------------
5. MULTI-MERCHANT CART AND ORDER MANAGEMENT
--------------------------------------------------

Implement a unified customer-facing cart and checkout.

Internally, create:

- One master customer order.
- Separate merchant suborders.
- Individual order lines and quantities.
- Merchant-specific fulfillment states.
- Shipment records.
- Payment records.
- Refund and cancellation records.
- Customer notifications.
- A complete order event history.

Support partial fulfillment, where appropriate.

For example, a customer may purchase five items from four merchants.
The system should create one master order and the required merchant
suborders, while retaining a clear relationship between all records.

Define how the system handles:

- Out-of-stock products.
- Merchant rejection.
- Payment failure.
- Duplicate payment notifications.
- Partial cancellation.
- Partial refunds.
- Delayed goods.
- Split shipments.
- Failed delivery.
- Customer complaints.
- Merchant disputes.

Ensure that payment processing and order creation are reliable
even when requests are repeated or network connectivity fails.

--------------------------------------------------
6. PAYMENT AND FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT
--------------------------------------------------

Develop a secure payment and reconciliation module.

Support:

- Approved payment-provider integrations.
- Payment initiation and confirmation.
- Verified payment webhooks.
- Transaction references.
- Order-level financial records.
- Merchant commission calculations.
- Disclosed platform fees.
- Delivery and handling charges.
- Merchant payout calculations.
- Refunds and adjustments.
- Reconciliation reports.
- Administrative financial reports.
- Auditable financial events.

Never rely solely on a customer's browser or application to confirm
that payment has succeeded.

Do not allow an AI model to independently authorize transfers,
change merchant balances, or override financial controls.

Use deterministic calculations, authorization checks, idempotent
transaction processing, and auditable financial records.

Determine the appropriate merchant settlement model before launch,
including the relationship between payment confirmation, fulfillment,
delivery, refunds, disputes, and payout eligibility.

Review applicable Nigerian legal, tax, consumer-protection, privacy,
and payment requirements before selecting the final payment model.

--------------------------------------------------
7. MERCHANT VERIFICATION AND TRUST
--------------------------------------------------

Build a merchant trust framework that includes:

- Identity and business verification.
- Product listing checks.
- Duplicate listing detection.
- Product documentation where applicable.
- Order accuracy records.
- Fulfillment performance.
- Cancellation rates.
- Customer complaints.
- Verified purchase reviews.
- Return and refund history.
- Suspicious activity detection.

Use AI to identify patterns requiring investigation.

AI-generated risk indicators must not automatically be treated
as proof of fraud.

Create review, escalation, correction, and appeal procedures for
important merchant decisions.

Develop product-specific verification procedures for the future
physical distribution hub.

--------------------------------------------------

evaluate practical route and consolidation alternatives.

Consider vehicle capacity, delivery windows, traffic information
where available, parcel characteristics, operating costs, and
delivery commitments.

Allow authorized operators to review or override recommendations.

Measure actual delivery cost and performance to improve future
planning.

Do not assume that the shortest route or the largest consolidated
shipment is always the best option.

16. IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY
--------------------------------------------------

Divide development into independently manageable workstreams.

WORKSTREAM A:
Customer application and user experience.

WORKSTREAM B:
Merchant onboarding and merchant portal.

WORKSTREAM C:
Product catalog, search, and product discovery.

WORKSTREAM D:
Cart, checkout, and order management.

WORKSTREAM E:
Payment processing and financial records.

WORKSTREAM F:
Merchant trust and verification.

WORKSTREAM G:
Physical hub and warehouse management.

WORKSTREAM H:
Logistics and delivery coordination.

WORKSTREAM I:
AI and business intelligence.

WORKSTREAM J:
Administration, analytics, security, and infrastructure.

For each workstream, generate:

- Functional requirements.
- Nonfunctional requirements.
- Architecture and data dependencies.
- User stories.
- Acceptance criteria.
- API specifications.
- Database requirements.
- Security considerations.
- Test cases.
- Development tasks.
- Estimated complexity.
- Required skills.
- Deliverables.
- Dependencies on other workstreams.
- Tasks that can be developed independently.
- Tasks that must wait for shared interfaces or infrastructure.

Identify a minimum viable product that can launch without the
complete physical distribution network.

Design the MVP to support future integration with the hub rather
than requiring a major redesign.

--------------------------------------------------
17. REQUIRED OUTPUT FROM THE PLANNING PROCESS
--------------------------------------------------

Produce the following deliverables in order:

1. A complete system requirements document.
2. A system architecture diagram.
3. A component and responsibility map.
4. A user journey map.
5. A complete order lifecycle diagram.
6. A merchant onboarding workflow.
7. A physical hub operating workflow.
8. An AI integration map.
9. A database entity relationship diagram.
10. An API contract outline.
11. A security and permissions model.
12. A payment and settlement workflow.
13. A logistics and distribution workflow.
14. A measurable MVP scope.
15. A phased implementation roadmap.
16. A dependency graph for all workstreams.
17. A parallel task assignment plan.
18. A testing and acceptance strategy.
19. A deployment and monitoring plan.
20. An initial operating budget and cost model.
21. A plan for expanding from one hub to a regional network.
22. A risk register identifying technical, financial, operational,
    legal, and marketplace risks.

For every proposed feature, distinguish between:

- REQUIRED FOR MVP.
- IMPORTANT AFTER INITIAL LAUNCH.
- LONG-TERM EXPANSION.
- OPTIONAL OR EXPERIMENTAL.

Do not begin by implementing every feature.

First produce the architecture, requirements, dependency graph,
MVP scope, and workstream task lists.

The final plan must be detailed enough that separate developers
or AI coding agents can work on independent components without
creating incompatible data models, API contracts, or assumptions.

When information is missing, state the assumption explicitly and
identify the decision that must be made before implementation.

Prioritize a practical, secure, maintainable marketplace that can
grow into a full distribution network.
